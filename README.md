# OCS_CS2_boxmodel
boxmodel to calculate marine concentrations and emissions of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and carbon disulfide (CS2)

This repository contains MatLab code for simulating the concentration of the trace gases carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide in the mixed layer of the ocean, and the corresponding emissions to the atmosphere. More details on the models can be found in the documents Readme_OCS.docx and Readme_CS2.docx in this repository.
